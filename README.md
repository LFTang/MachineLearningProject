# MachineLearningProject

This repo contains solution to the Pracitical Machine Learning course project in Coursera. 

The current project uses a movement dataset (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) to predict exercise category. We used a random forest model and applied a 10 fold cross-validation technique. Comparing with other methods, the random forest model showed high overall accuracy, with more than 99.9% of prediction success (<.1% error rate).
